# AI Development Journal

## Session Summary

**Date:** [Today]

### Chronological Key Interactions

1. **Project Initialization & Local Run**
   - User requested to run the project locally.
   - Installed dependencies and resolved missing vite command error.
   - Started the Vite dev server and confirmed the app was running at http://localhost:5173.

2. **Feature Addition: '15' Button**
   - User requested a new button labeled '15' to load a list of 15 names.
   - Created `public/list15.txt` with placeholder names.
   - Added a new button and implemented the `load15Names` function in `App.tsx`.
   - Added unit tests for the new button using Vitest and React Testing Library.
   - Verified tests failed before implementation and passed after.

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Vitest, React Testing Library, and jsdom for unit testing.
   - Configured Vite for testing and added a test setup file.
   - Ensured all new features are covered by tests.

4. **UI Centering & Polish**
   - User requested the UI to be centered on the page.
   - Iteratively updated the layout to achieve perfect vertical and horizontal centering with a full background.
   - Addressed issues with background not covering the viewport and content not being centered.

5. **PWA Upgrade**
   - User requested to make the app a PWA.
   - Installed and configured `vite-plugin-pwa`.
   - Added a manifest and placeholder icons for installability.
   - Provided instructions for generating or replacing icons.

6. **UI Enhancement: Remove Name Button**
   - User requested the 'x' button for removing names to be larger and styled to match the theme.
   - Updated the button to use a larger font size, theme color, and added accessibility improvements.

7. **Participants List & Selection Logic**
   - Previously selected names are now crossed out in the participants list, with their selection order shown in parentheses.
   - The remove button is hidden for already selected names.
   - All names remain visible after selection.
   - Excluded already selected names from being picked again.

8. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Responsive grid for participants list (2 columns mobile, 3 tablet, 4 desktop, 5 xl).
   - Improved button layout: grouped, highlighted active, responsive.
   - Visual feedback: highlight and animate newly selected name before crossing out.

9. **Spin Duration Feature**
   - Added a sleeker, modern slider for spin duration (3â€“7s) with floating label and tick marks.
   - Slider only appears if the user visits with `?time=true` in the URL.

10. **Testing**
    - Added a unit test to verify random selection is truly random.
    - Updated the '15' button test to check for all names instead of a heading.

11. **Title Interactions**
    - Double-clicking 'Randomly' toggles the Custom button.
    - Double-clicking 'next?' toggles the spin duration slider (time query param).

12. **Mobile-Friendly Participants List**
    - Made the participants list more mobile-friendly by using responsive font size, reduced padding and gap on mobile, and a more compact scroll area. This ensures all 15 names are visible on devices like the Pixel 9 Pro, and works with the dynamic column setup.

13. **Documentation**
    - Created and updated this journal in `.ai/journal.md` to document the session.

## Notes
- Placeholder icons are used for PWA; replace with your own for production.
- All changes are live in the running dev server; refresh to see updates.
- The project is now testable, PWA-ready, and has improved UI/UX.
