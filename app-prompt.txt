Scaffold UI with Shadcn
Create an app called “Who is next?”.  It will take a list of names of people to pick from.  Keep it limited to 1000 names.  After that give a message saying you have reached the 1000 name limit.  Initialize the list with 10 random first names.  When user clicks the button, it should start the random selection process.
When clicking “Pick Random Name”, show a clock and let it spin for about 7 seconds.  Keep a ticking sound while it’s spinning.  When time is up, declare “And the person selected to be next is :   ?’ and repalce ? with the selected winner along with confetti and “hooray type” sound.
